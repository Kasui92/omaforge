<h1 align="center">Omaforge</h1>

Omaforge can be considered a personalized derivative of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh Ubuntu install into a modern development environment. It takes Omakub a step further, transforming GNOME with [Forge](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge) into a tiling-like, streamlined workspace â€” minimal, opinionated, and developer-focused, inspired by [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).

This is an **experiment**, a concept to demonstrate that it is possible to deeply customize GNOME.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
>
> [Forge is currently seeking maintainers](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge?tab=readme-ov-file#forge-needs-a-new-maintainer), so this project, while well-maintained, may have several issues and not be supported for future Ubuntu LTS releases. Due to this situation and maintenance difficulties, **production or daily basis use are not recommended**.

Omaforge is designed to transform a fresh **Ubuntu Server LTS** installation into a complete development environment. Make sure you have:

- A fresh Ubuntu Server LTS installation (24.04)
- A stable internet connection (the setup downloads packages and extensions)
- At least 30 minutes for the complete installation process

To install Omaforge, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://omakasui.org/omaforge | bash
```

You can also install Omaforge in its "development" version to experiment and/or contribute, but you accept all the risks involved (and a few coffees won't always be enough). This is the command, for the brave:
